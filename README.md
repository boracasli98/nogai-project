# The Nogai Project
The project aims to provide the verb conjugation and noun declension tables, collaborative dictionaries to Turkish, Russian and English or vice versa and even corpora for neural machine translation (NMT) projects for the Nogai language spoken in Dagestan and Karachay-Cherkessia, a language belonging to the Kipchak subgroup of the Turkic language family. All the tables have to be in the same format (in this context, HTML), but corpora and dictionaries don't have to.

# Can I contribute?
If your native language is Nogai or you have a decent knowledge of Nogai, you're more than welcome. A working knowledge of Russian is preferred, but not required.

# I don't know the Cyrillic alphabet. Can I use the Latin script to write Nogai?
Unfortunately, since the Latin script is not an official script for the Nogai language, the answer is no. Even if you write in Latin script, the owner and the moderators of this repository reserve the right to convert them into Cyrillic script.
